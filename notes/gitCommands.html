<ul>

    <li>
        <b>git status</b>
        <p>gives status on a git repository and its contents</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git init</b>
        <p>creates a new repository for the current folder. Before initialize a repo, run git status first to make sure
            that the current location is not being watched by git.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git add</b>
        <p>stages changes before you can commit them. To stage multiple files at once, separate files with spaces, like:
            git add file1 file2</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git add .</b>
        <p>stages all changes at once</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git rm --cached fileName</b>
        <p>unstages a staged file</p>
    </li>

    <h2>Commit</h2>

    <li>
        <b>git commit -m "my message about the commitment"</b>
        <p>moves the staged changes from the staging area to the repository.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
        <b>git commit -a -m "my message about the commitment"</b>
        <p>shortcut for staging and committing all files at once.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git commit --amend</b>
        <p>allows you to add a forgotten file(s) to the last commit or edit the message from the last commit. If the
            idea
            is to add a file, you'll have to stage it first with git add.</p>
    </li>

    <h2>Branch</h2>

    <li>
        <b>git branch</b>
        <p>gives the list of existing branches. And the one with an * is the active branch</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git branch -v</b>
        <p>gives the list of existing branches, and their last commitment message.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git branch name_of_branch</b>
        <p>creates a new branch but it does not switch to it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git switch name_of_branch</b>
        <p>goes to the named branch</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git switch -c name_of_branch</b>
        <p>creates a new branch and navigates to it at once</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git branch -m newName</b>
        <p>modifies/renames the current branch</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b><b>git branch -d name_of_branch</b></b>
        <p>deletes branch. However, to make this work, this branch has be merged first. If you don't want to merge it,
            you can force the deletion by using uppercase d, -D, instead of -d. Remember to leave the branch before
            deleting it.</p>
    </li>

    <h2>Merge</h2>

    <li>
        <b>git merge branchName</b>
        <p>before merging, remember to switch to the master or the branch that you want the current branch to be merged
            into.</p>
    </li>

    <h2>Diff</h2>

    <li>
        <b>git diff</b>

    <li>
        <b>git diff --staged OR --cached</b>
        <p>lists the difference between the staging area and the last commit</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git diff (HEAD or --staged or nothing) fileName </b>
        <p>will show the differences inside the specific file</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>git diff branch1..branch2 </b>
        <p>show differences between two branches. In this case, the order matters. branch1 will occupy the "old" or "a"
            or "---" and branch2 will be the "new" or "b" or "+++"</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <b>git diff commit1..commit2 </b>
        <p>show differences between two commits. In this case, the order matters. commit1 will occupy the "old" or "a"

        When switching in between branches, you can receive an error due to conflicting uncommitted changes. However,
        when the changes are not conflicting, this error won't appear. In this case, those changes will "go with you" to
        the next branch and to the next, until you commit them. <b>Always commit all changes before switching in between
            branches.</b>

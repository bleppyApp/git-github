    <li>
        When switching in between branches, you can receive an error due to conflicting uncommitted changes. However,
        when the changes are not conflicting, this error won't appear. In this case, those changes will "go with you" to
        the next branch and to the next, until you commit them. <b>Always commit all changes before switching in between
            branches.</b>
    </li>

    <li>When you merge, the branch being merged is not deleted. Also, the merge doesn't mean that both branches will be in sync forever. They're only equal from the moment of the merge up to the moment when a new change is made in any of the two branches.</li>
